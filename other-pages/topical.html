    <h2 class="topical-headings">Should this law be implemented?</h2>

    <p class="topical-paragraphs">
      The main theme of the case is really the term “Fake news”, how hard it
      can be to identify and define this term, and all the problems that comes
      with battling inaccurate or false information spread deliberately or not
      to our society. Our modern technology has made it incredibly easy to
      create content and spread it effectively and globally. With the
      emergence of AI-tools this has become an even more apparent problem
      because of the rate of false or inaccurate information is created and
      spread in our society. As it-engineers a future challenge will be
      finding ways to discover, regulate, and moderate this phenomenon we call
      Fake News through digital tools and systems.

    <h2 class="topical-headings">New Law</h2>

    <p class="topical-paragraphs">
      Banning AI generated content entirely could be seen as a restriction on
      freedom of speech. People have the right to express themselves,
      including using modern technology and tools such as AI. Instead of a
      total ban, efforts could be focused on improving public awareness.
      Educating voters on how to identify and critically evaluate AI-generated
      content and can empower them to make informed decisions. Another thing
      they should consider is developing a regulatory framework that set
      guidelines and standards for the responsible use of AI in political
      campaigns and that should do the trick. This could include transparency
      requirements, disclosure of AI generated content, and penalties for
      deliberate misinformation. All in all this law should not be passed into
      action!

      <ul class="third-topical-list">
        <li>
          An unintended consequence might be putting too much regulative power
          in Government authorities through this law. A government role in
          journalism should not only be either to do nothing and let companies
          control everything, or control things for propaganda purposes.
        </li>

        <li>
          It is the citizens and political campaigns that stand to lose from
          this technology.Citizens can be manipulated into not voting with
          their conscience.
        </li>
        <li>
          Political campaigns may lose their competitiveness if they fail to
          adapt to the technology with AI. This technology can be of use to
          politicians.
        </li>

        <li>
          It can make the work process more efficient for them. For example,
          AI may have data analytics for more exact targeting of campaign
          messaging and outreach initiatives.
        </li>

        <li>
          The law can be implemented by blocking access to AI and it’s
          important to have a type of follow-up to make sure that campaigns
          are following the law. The use of AI can result in consequences such
          as a fine.
